# klipper-extended-corexy-kinematic
Klipper module for extended-corexy kinematic support. 

## Adjusted by the VzBoT team to support AWD (multiple motors per axis)

Based on [SnakeOil Extended CoreXY Klipper Module](https://github.com/SnakeOilXY/klipper-extended-corexy-kinematic)

## 1. Introduction
This kinematic is based on traditional CoreXY and hybrid-CoreXY (aka Markforged kinematic), aiming to improve the performance of large CoreXY-based 3D printers.

Check [kinematic page](./doc/kinematic.md) for more information about this kinematic.

## 2. Current firmware support state

 Support for extended coreXY kinematic is not merged into mainline Klipper yet, but we have working code and over 100 hours of test print without problem. There is plan to submit PR for this kinematic in the future. 

 You can find sample config at [sample config page](./doc/config.md)

 If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to ask on our [SnakeOilXY discord](https://discord.gg/WZVP2HuAag)
